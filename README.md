# DiskOrganizer

## Overview

DiskOrganizer is a Python-based application designed to help reorganize disk space to improve file system performance and speed up access on Windows systems. It performs tasks such as analyzing disk usage, defragmenting the drive (placeholder), and organizing files into subdirectories based on their extensions.

## Features

- Analyze disk space to determine total, used, and free space.
- Organize files into directories based on their file extensions.
- Placeholder for defragmentation of the drive to improve access speed.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Windows operating system

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DiskOrganizer.git
   cd DiskOrganizer
   ```

2. **Run the DiskOrganizer script:**

   ```bash
   python DiskOrganizer.py
   ```

   Make sure to modify the `target_drive` variable in the script to point to the drive you wish to organize (e.g., `C:\\`).

## Note

- The defragmentation feature is currently a placeholder and does not perform actual defragmentation. This would typically require administrative privileges and the use of system-specific tools.
